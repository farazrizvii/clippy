Clippy AI – Floating Desktop Assistant
A cross-platform Electron + React AI widget for productivity, automation & real-time AI interaction
 Overview

Clippy AI is a desktop-native AI assistant interface built using Electron + React + TypeScript.
It works as a floating widget on top of your desktop, draggable, resizable and built for fast AI access without opening a browser or terminal.

This project demonstrates:

✔ Cross-platform desktop development with Electron
✔ React + Tailwind UI architecture & state management
✔ Real-time OpenAI/Gemini chat integration
✔ Local storage persistence (history + settings)
✔ Custom animated canvas background + theme design
✔ Secure API key handling without storing or exposing keys

You launch it → type → get answers instantly like a system-level assistant.
